# Agent Analytics & Observability

As AI agents move from prototype to production, organizations face a critical challenge: the "black box" of agent execution. Understanding how agents reason, which tools they call, how many tokens they consume, and why a specific path failed is essential for enterprise deployment.

## Core Initiatives

### BigQuery Agent Analytics

[BigQuery Agent Analytics](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/introducing-bigquery-agent-analytics) is the recommended pattern for centralizing agent interaction data. By routing your agent's execution telemetry to BigQuery, you enable:

- **Runtime Observability:** Track agent trajectories, tool call success/failure rates, and end-to-end latency in real-time.
- **Cost & Token Management:** Monitor token consumption across different models and usage patterns to optimize cloud spend.
- **Continuous Evaluation:** Build datasets of "golden" interactions to feed into evaluation frameworks like EvalBench.
- **Enterprise Governance:** Maintain a secure, auditable log of every action an agent takes within your infrastructure.

Whether you are building with Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK), LangGraph, or custom orchestration, BigQuery provides the scalable, analytical backend needed to understand your agents.

### Learning Resources & Tutorials

Rather than maintaining custom recipes here, we recommend following the official Google Cloud documentation and hands-on guides to set up Agent Analytics:

* 📖 **[ADK Integration Documentation](https://adk.dev/integrations/bigquery-agent-analytics/)**: The official guide for configuring the BigQuery exporter within the Agent Development Kit.
* 🎓 **[Codelab: ADK BigQuery Agent Analytics Plugin](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/adk-bigquery-agent-analytics-plugin#0)**: A step-by-step interactive tutorial on setting up telemetry, defining the BigQuery schema, and exporting logs.
