# UCP Analytics — Sample Implementation

A two-file reference for capturing
[Universal Commerce Protocol](https://ucp.dev) (UCP) traffic from an
[httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org/) client and streaming events
into a partitioned, clustered BigQuery table.

This is a **sample**, not a framework. Two files make up the adapter
you copy into your project — `ucp_analytics.py` (parser + writer +
tracker) and `sample_agent.py` (reference shape for the agent-emitted
event types). A sibling `quickstart.py` is the runnable demo and
`smoke_test.py` is the spec-coverage regression check. Licensed
[Apache 2.0](../LICENSE), Copyright 2026 Google LLC.

Covers all 32 event types in the UCP spec: 27 derivable from HTTPX
traffic by the parser; 6 emitted by your agent loop via the included
`SampleAgent` shape; `order_webhook_received` overlaps both surfaces
(parser sees inbound POSTs; agent is the entry point for
server-side webhook handlers). 27 + 6 − 1 = 32.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/data-agent-kit.git
cd data-agent-kit/ucp-analytics
```

`quickstart.py` declares its runtime dependency inline via
[PEP 723](https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/), so you can run it
directly with [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) without any
explicit install step:

```bash
uv run quickstart.py YOUR_GCP_PROJECT
```

With pip, install the two runtime deps once and run with
`python`:

```bash
pip install httpx google-cloud-bigquery
python quickstart.py YOUR_GCP_PROJECT
```

There is intentionally no `pyproject.toml` — these are sample files
you read and copy, not a package you depend on.

## Quickstart

The canonical runnable sample is [`quickstart.py`](./quickstart.py).
One positional argument (`project_id`), ADC auth, end-to-end against
your own BigQuery dataset:

```bash
# 1. Auth (uses Application Default Credentials).
gcloud auth application-default login

# 2. Run the quickstart against your project.
uv run quickstart.py YOUR_GCP_PROJECT

# Optional dataset / table overrides:
uv run quickstart.py YOUR_GCP_PROJECT \
    --dataset-id ucp_analytics \
    --table-id ucp_events
```

The quickstart demonstrates the agent-emission pattern — three
`SampleAgent` calls (`capability_negotiated`,
`payment_handler_negotiated`, `payment_completed`) that each land
one row in BigQuery. To capture HTTP traffic via the `httpx` hook
instead, see `ucp_analytics.UCPTracker.record` and
`make_event_hook` in `ucp_analytics.py`.

## Smoke test (no GCP credentials needed)

```bash
python smoke_test.py
```

Drives 33 synthetic events through the full pipeline (parser +
agent), prints each row as a JSON line, and asserts that every one
of the 32 UCP event types appears at least once. Exits non-zero if
coverage regresses.

The smoke test lives in `smoke_test.py` (sibling file) and imports
the public surfaces of both `ucp_analytics.py` and
`sample_agent.py`. It is a regression check on the sample — the
multi-mode CLI exists for testing, not as a template to copy. The
canonical sample is `quickstart.py`.

## End-to-end against real BigQuery

```bash
# Auth once (uses Application Default Credentials).
gcloud auth application-default login

# Stream the same 33 rows into BigQuery and verify they're queryable.
python smoke_test.py \
    --e2e \
    --project-id YOUR_GCP_PROJECT \
    --verify

# Or without --verify if you just want to write and not wait:
python smoke_test.py --e2e --project-id YOUR_GCP_PROJECT
```

What `--e2e` does:

1. Generates a unique `merchant_host` tag (`smoke-{uuid}.example.com`)
   so this run's rows are filterable in the table.
2. Auto-creates the dataset (default `ucp_analytics_e2e`) and table
   (default `ucp_events_smoke`) on first run, partitioned by
   `timestamp` and clustered by `(event_type, checkout_session_id)`.
3. Streams all 33 rows through `BQWriter` and drains the buffer.
4. With `--verify`, polls the table with backoff (up to
   `--verify-timeout` seconds, default 90) until every row from this
   run is queryable, then prints `verify ok`.

The auto-created table is the same schema (13 columns) the live
`BQWriter` writes to in your own integration. Drop the dataset when
you're done — it's tagged `_e2e` for that reason.

## What it does

| Surface | Code |
|---|---|
| Path-based classifier (checkout / cart / catalog / order / identity / discovery / webhook / error / fallback) | `classify(method, path, status, body)` |
| Body-derived order lifecycle (`shipped` / `delivered` / `returned` / `canceled` from `fulfillment.events[]` or `adjustments[]`) | `_lifecycle_from_body(body)` |
| Body-field extractor (id, currency, total amount, first error code) | `extract_fields(body)` |
| Async buffered streaming insert into a partitioned, clustered table | `BQWriter` |
| `httpx` response event hook gluing the parser to the writer | `UCPTracker.record` + `make_event_hook` |
| Manual entry point for non-HTTPX events | `UCPTracker.record_event` |
| Reference shape for an agent's analytics emission (payment, capability negotiation, webhook receipts) | `SampleAgent` (in `sample_agent.py`) |

Schema is 13 columns, defined as a list of tuples at the top of
`ucp_analytics.py`. Add columns there when your dashboards need them.

### Event coverage

The parser derives 27 event types from HTTPX responses (path +
method + status + body); `SampleAgent` (or your own
`tracker.record_event` calls) emits the other 5 plus an overlap on
`order_webhook_received`:

| Source | Events |
|---|---|
| HTTPX parser (27) | `profile_discovered`, `checkout_session_{created,get,updated,completed,canceled}`, `checkout_escalation`, `cart_{created,get,updated,canceled}`, `catalog_{search,lookup,product_get}`, `order_{created,get,updated,shipped,delivered,returned,canceled,webhook_received}`, `identity_link_{initiated,completed,revoked}`, `error`, `request` |
| `SampleAgent` (5 unique + 1 overlap) | `capability_negotiated`, `payment_handler_negotiated`, `payment_instrument_selected`, `payment_completed`, `payment_failed`, **`order_webhook_received`** (overlaps with parser — use whichever path your handler runs in) |

Total distinct: 32. The smoke test emits 33 rows (27 parser + 6
agent) and asserts all 32 distinct types appear.

## What it doesn't do (fork for any of this)

- FastAPI / Starlette server-side middleware
- Google ADK plugin
- MCP / A2A / JSON-RPC transport handling
- HTTP message signing (RFC 9421) parsing
- `WWW-Authenticate` Bearer challenge parsing (RFC 7235 / 6750)
- Standard Webhooks header-pair signature verification
- AP2 mandates, authorization signals, embedded checkout config
- PII redaction
- Per-PR / per-merchant column splits

The classifier is deliberately a flat list of substring checks; the
extractor knows about exactly four body fields. Both are easy to
read and easy to grow.
