# Data Agent Kit

This repository serves as the central hub for embedding the Agentic Data Cloud across your favorite developer-focused AI tools. 

Whether you are a developer vibe-coding in Claude Code, an enterprise engineer using the Gemini CLI, or an agent builder constructing complex systems with LangGraph, this kit provides the prescriptive tools like **Skills and MCP servers** you need to interact safely and efficiently with [Google Data Cloud products](https://cloud.google.com/data-cloud).

## 📓 What's Included

The Data Agent Kit is currently organized as an index pointing to product-specific extensions, MCP configurations, and builder tools.

- [Extensions & Plugins](#individual-extensions--plugins)
- [MCP Servers](#model-context-protocol-mcp)
- [Agent Evaluations & Monitoring](#agent-evaluations--monitoring)

## 🏬 Extensions & Plugins Marketplace

Extensions and plugins are the primary way to inject specialized capabilities into your AI agents. Think of a plugin marketplace as a digital registry or catalog that makes it easy to discover, share, and install these tools directly into your environment. By installing these packages, you equip tools like Gemini CLI, Claude Code, and Codex with the exact **Skills, Prompts, and MCP Servers** they need to understand and interact with your Google Data Cloud infrastructure.

### 📦 Individual Extensions & Plugins

These extensions package product-specific Skills and MCP servers for use in any of your AI tools. Refer to the specific product repositories linked above for installation and configuration requirements.

| Product | Location | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Agent Kit Starter Pack** | https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/data-agent-kit-starter-pack | This plugin provides a specialized suite of skills for data users using BigQuery and Managed Apache Spark  along with Knowledge catalog. It acts as an expert assistant, allowing you to use natural language prompts in your preferred coding agent to architect complex data pipelines, transform data with dbt, write Spark and BigQuery SQL notebooks, and orchestrate end-to-end workflows across the GCP data ecosystem. |
| **AlloyDB for PostgreSQL** | https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/alloydb | Create, connect, and interact with an AlloyDB for PostgreSQL database and data. |
| **AlloyDB Omni** | https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/alloydb-omni | Create, connect, and interact with an AlloyDB Omni database and data. |

| **Spanner** | https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/spanner | Connect and interact with Spanner data using natural language. |


## 🧩 Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers

If you are building your own agents or using an interface that supports raw MCP connections, check our comprehensive guide on utilizing **Google Cloud MCP Servers** vs. the open-source **MCP Toolbox**.
* 📖 **[View MCP Configurations](./mcp-servers/README.md)**

## 📊 Agent Evaluations & Monitoring

For developers building production agents (e.g., using ADK or LangGraph), we provide opinionated guidance on making your agents observable, safe, and measurable.
* **[Agent Analytics](./agent-analytics/README.md):** Track usage and performance of agents using BigQuery.
* **[Agent Evaluation](./agent-evaluation/README.md):** Benchmark and test your agents using EvalBench.
* **[UCP Analytics](./ucp-analytics/README.md):** Two-file sample implementation that parses [Universal Commerce Protocol](https://ucp.dev) traffic from an `httpx` event hook and streams events into a partitioned, clustered BigQuery table. Covers all 32 UCP spec event types (27 from the parser, 6 from the included `SampleAgent`, one overlap). Ships a `quickstart.py` you can run against your own GCP project plus a `smoke_test.py` regression check. Copy `ucp_analytics.py` (parser + writer + tracker) and `sample_agent.py` (agent-emitted event types) into your project and grow the classifier / schema as needed.

## Security Reminder: Agent Environment Hardening

Your agent can execute tools and commands on your behalf. Protect your Google
Cloud resources by enforcing **The Principle of Least Privilege** across all
CLIs, MCP servers and other resources available to your agents.

*   **Service Accounts:** Use
    [service accounts](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/use-service-account-impersonation)
    instead of end user credentials to access Google Cloud resources.
*   **Limited Permissions:** Assign roles with
    [limited permissions](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview)
    to the service account that you're using for authentication.
*   **Principal Access Boundaries:** Prevent unwanted cross-org agent access by
    using
    [Principal Access Boundary policies](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/principal-access-boundary-policies#use-case-one-project)
    to scope your agent to projects you intend it to access.
*   [Include a condition in the policy binding](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/principal-access-boundary-policies#use-case-one-project)
    to ensure that the policy only applies to the service accounts that you
    intend to restrict.
